# Hello, World! 👋

I am a Software Engineering student. Currently, I study at the Faculty of Computer Science in Coruña (FIC).

I use my GitHub to have a backup of my notes, by the way, made in Markdown with Obsidian, and to upload exercises and projects that I work on over time.

📍 **Lugo / A Coruña, Spain**
